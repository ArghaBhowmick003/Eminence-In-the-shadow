                Cid Kagenou, also known by his alias Shadow, is the enigmatic protagonist of light novel series, "The
                Eminence in Shadow". A reincarnated youth obsessed with becoming a mastermind operating from the
                shadows, Cid meticulously crafted a backstory for himself.

                Publicly known as a background character named Minoru, Cid secretly founded Shadow Garden, an
                organization dedicated to fighting a supposed hidden evil cult, "The Cult of Diablos". Ironically, the
                "Cult" was Cid's invention, but unbeknownst to him, it turns out to be a real threat.

                Despite his delusional facade, Cid is a genius strategist and swordsman. He manipulates situations to
                fuel his fantasy, unknowingly becoming a true leader to the devoted members of Shadow Garden. Cid's
                obliviousness to the real dangers and his over-the-top chuunibyo (desire to be like a villain in a
                fantasy world) personality are the source of much of the series' humor.
